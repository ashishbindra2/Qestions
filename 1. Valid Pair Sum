Given an array of size N, find the number of distinct pairs {a[i], a[j]} (i != j) in the array with their sum greater than 0.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, a[] = {3, -2, 1}
Output: 2
Explanation: {3, -2}, {3, 1} are two 
possible pairs.
Example 2:

Input: N = 4, a[] = {-1, -1, -1, 0}
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no possible pairs.
